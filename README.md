# Terrain Identification RNN
**Credits to:** Xander Carruth, Hosung Hwang, Utsab Ray

We created a Recurrent Neural Network which predicts the type of terrain a person is walking on based on gyroscope data. We preprocessed terrain data and used SMOTE upsampling to generate more useful data for this model and then fine-tuned the model for high accuracy predictions on the data. For more information on this project, please see [this document](Terrain%20Detector%20Analysis.pdf).
